# Learn Android With Kotlin

This Project Helps you to Learn Android using Kotlin language. 
The project consist of different branches, each branch dedicated to explanation and usage of specific View (concept) in Android.

## Benefits of Learning
You Learn Android Concepts & Kotlin Concepts hand-in-hand

## How to Use the code 
### (Copy & Paste this Kotlin Code as per requirement & Understand the Kotlin documentation from Links provided)

## Prerequisite (Read at least once)
1. [Kotlin Basic Syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html)
2. [Kotlin Basic Types Knowledge](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-types.html)
3. [Kotlin Control Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/control-flow.html)

2. Data can be of String, boolean, double, int etc type.
3. No major kotlin concepts used, very similar to java way of creating Bundle, add data, set bundle data to fragment, get data from bundle.

**Branch 8 : radiogroup_kotlin :**
1. This helps us to understand how RadioGroup, RadioButton is used in Android using Kotlin.

2. We also understand how checkChangeListener of checkbox is used for checkbox events.
3. It is almost similar java implementation with some syntax changes of Kotlin.

**Branch 10 : recyclerview_kotlin :**
1. This help us to understand how Recyclerview is implemented in Android with Kotlin.
2. It's almost a similar way how Recyclerview is implemented Java way.
3. Here also we deal with Adapter class, clickListener event for Recyclerview.
4. Reference for how Lamba can be used as ClickListener for RecyclerView [Tutorial](https://www.andreasjakl.com/recyclerview-kotlin-style-click-listener-android/).

**Branch 11 : navigationdrawer_kotlin :**
1. This help us to understand how basic Navigation Drawer can be implemented in Android using Kotlin.
2. The best thing is almost similar implementation of Java way with very less code.
3. Navigation Drawer items click & adding menu item xml is same like Java
