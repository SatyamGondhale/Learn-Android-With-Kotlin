###(Copy & Paste this Kotlin Code as per requirement & Understand the Kotlin documentation from Links provided)

**Branch 1 : say_goodbye_to_findViewById_using_kotlin :**
1. This helps you to understand how you can get rid of boilerplate code of traditional **findViewById()**. 
2. It also helps us to understand how view properties can be accessed programmatically
3. This is possible because of Kotlin plugin.
4. This will allow you to access views in the layout XML, just as if they were properties with the name of the id you used in the layout definition.
