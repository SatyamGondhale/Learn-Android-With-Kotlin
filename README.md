# Learn Android With Kotlin

This Project Helps you to Learn Android using Kotlin language. 
The project consist of different branches, each branch dedicated to explanation and usage of specific View (concept) in Android.

## Benefits of Learning
You Learn Android Concepts & Kotlin Concepts hand-in-hand

## How to Use the code 
### (Copy & Paste this Kotlin Code as per requirement & Understand the Kotlin documentation from Links provided)

## Prerequisite (Read at least once)
1. [Kotlin Basic Types Knowledge](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-types.html)
2. [Kotlin Control Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/control-flow.html)
3. [Kotlin Function](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/functions.html)
4. [Must Read Kotlin Lambdas](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html)
5. [Kotlin Collections](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/collections-overview.html)

**Branch 1 : say_goodbye_to_findViewById_using_kotlin :**
1. This helps you to understand how you can get rid of boilerplate code of traditional **findViewById()**. 
2. It also helps us to understand how view properties can be accessed programmatically
3. This is possible because of Kotlin plugin.
4. This will allow you to access views in the layout XML, just as if they were properties with the name of the id you used in the layout definition.
5. For More details read : [Kotlin Android Extensions](https://antonioleiva.com/kotlin-android-extensions/)

**Branch 2 : edittext_kotlin :**
1. This helps you to understand how **Fragments** & **EditText** can be used with Kotlin code.
2. We learn here How **Fragments** can be declared, accessed & How **EditText** can be used.
3. Kotlin concepts used here are : 
   - [Kotlin Companion Objects](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-for-py/objects-and-companion-objects.html)
   - [Use of requireActivity()]( https://android.jlelse.eu/the-requireactivity-and-requirecontext-example-1c089ce11a3a)
   
   
 **Branch 3 : toast_message_kotlin :**
 1. This helps us to understand how Toast message in displayed with Kotlin Code. 
 2. Almost similar to Java way of displaying message
 3. As we know requireActivity(), is used to get Activity Context in Fragment
 4. Another way of getting Activity context can be seen in code
 5. We also learn how to show Custom Toast message with custom view, setting Gravity for Message where it should be displayed.
 
 
 **Branch 4 : dialogs_kotlin :**
 1. This helps us to understand how Dialog message is displayed with Kotlin Code.
 2. We also learn how to add Positive, Negative, Neutral button for dialog also given here.
 3. Custom Layout for dialog can also be added for dialog with custom views
 
 **Branch 5 : listview_kotlin :**
 1. This help us to understand how ListView is displayed with kotlin Code.
 2. Also, how Simple & Custom ListView with custom view, and of custom type works in kotlin.
 3. We can see a very little difference in Java & Kotlin implmentation for custom ListView.
 4. Kotlin concepts used here are :
    - [Kotlin Classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-for-py/classes.html)
    - [Kotlin Collections](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/collections-overview.html)
    - [Kotlin List Operations](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/list-operations.html)
    
**Branch 6 : pass_data_activity :**
1. This help us to understand how data can be transferred from one Activity to another using Intent.
2. Data can be of String, boolean, double etc type.
3. Minor things like getting activity context in Fragment, finish activty in kotlin also explained here.

**Branch 7 : pass_data_fragment :**
1. This helps us to understand how data can be transferred from one Fragment to another using Bundle.
2. Data can be of String, boolean, double, int etc type.
3. No major kotlin concepts used, very similar to java way of creating Bundle, add data, set bundle data to fragment, get data from bundle.

**Branch 8 : radiogroup_kotlin :**
1. This helps us to understand how RadioGroup, RadioButton is used in Android using Kotlin.
2. We also understand how radio group is accessed, checkedChangeListener of radio button, how to get selected radio button data etc.
3. Also, different ways of accessing individual radio button and selected radio button properties.

**Branch 9 : checkbox_kotlin :**
1. This helps us to understand how Checkbox is used in Android using Kotlin.
2. We also understand how checkChangeListener of checkbox is used for checkbox events.
3. It is almost similar java implementation with some syntax changes of Kotlin.
